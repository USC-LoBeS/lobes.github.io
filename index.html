Brain: We study the structure and function of the human brain through multimodal neuroimaging and neuroinformatics. We aim to reliably identify factors that contribute to the brain's risk (or resilience) for a wide range of conditions, including neurological and psychiatric disorders.  We use large scale population studies in the hopes of tracking and understanding changes at the individual level. More details and information about specific projects can be found on our research pages. <br>

eScience "is defined broadly as big computational science, team science and networked science. It includes all scientific domains, as well as biomedicine and social sciences that share research approaches with the sciences. eScience is about global collaboration in key areas of science and the next generation of infrastructure that it will enable and support. Researchers working within eScience could require access to very large data collections and large scale computing resources in order to share their data with others, or they could require access to smaller data collections where a number of different researchers need to be involved. The principle idea surrounding eScience is that it is collaborative in nature, providing opportunities for researchers and scientists to share their data; discuss new avenues for research; and work together to produce better results." <br>

Brain eScience (pronounced: brainy science -- yes that was intentional!) uses large computational infrastructures, incorporates highly collaborative projects, and builds bridges between internationally distributed data, to understand the structure and function of the human brain throughout the lifespan. <br>
